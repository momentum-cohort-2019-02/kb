# Week 4

## Day 1

- Introduction to Django

### Assignment

- Read and follow along with the [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) up through Chapter 4
- The section on [Setting up a Django development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment) follows different guidelines than we do. To set up a Django development environment on your computer, follow these guidelines:
  - Make a directory for your project and use `cd` to move into that directory.
  - Run `pipenv install django`.
  - Run `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment where you now have Django installed.
  - To start your Django project, run `django-admin startproject <project_name> .` where `<project_name>` is replaced with your project name. **Note the period after the project name.** If you don't put that, another directory will be created, which you don't want.
